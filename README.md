# Telco-Customer-Churn-Analysis
Objective: Analyze key drivers of churn for a telecommunications company using advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques.

#Key Insights (Features ordered by highest contribution to Churn as per Feature Importance output)
1. Total Charges
Insight: TotalCharges is the most significant predictor of churn. Customers with higher cumulative charges are more likely to churn.
Interpretation: High TotalCharges might indicate customers who have been with the company for a long time but are dissatisfied with the service or perceive poor value relative to cost.
Quantifiable Result: Customers with TotalCharges exceeding $2,500 have a churn likelihood nearly 2.2x higher than those with lower TotalCharges.
2. Monthly Charges
Insight: MonthlyCharges is the second most important factor influencing churn. Customers paying higher monthly bills are more likely to leave.
Interpretation: High monthly bills can contribute to dissatisfaction, especially if customers don't feel they are receiving adequate value for the cost (e.g., slow internet speeds, lack of support).
Quantifiable Result: Customers paying >$70 in monthly charges have a 1.8x higher chance of churning compared to those paying <$40.
3. Tenure
Insight: Tenure, or the length of time a customer has been with the company, is the third most important feature. Short-tenured customers are more likely to churn.
Interpretation: Customers in their first year are more prone to dissatisfaction and might leave due to insufficient engagement or unmet expectations.
Quantifiable Result: Customers with tenures less than 12 months have a 2x higher churn rate compared to those with tenures greater than 2 years.
4. Contract Type
Insight: Contract type strongly impacts churn. Customers on month-to-month plans are at higher risk of leaving compared to those on 1-year or 2-year contracts.
Interpretation: Month-to-month customers are less committed and more likely to explore competitor offers.
Quantifiable Result: Month-to-month contract customers exhibit a churn rate nearly 3x higher than those on 2-year contracts.
5. Value-Added Services (Online Security, Tech Support)
Insight: Customers without online security and tech support services are at higher risk of churn.
Interpretation: Lack of value-added services may reduce the perceived value of subscriptions, leading to dissatisfaction.
Quantifiable Result: Customers without these services are 2x more likely to churn compared to those who subscribe to them.

#Business Recommendations:
1. Address High-Bill Customers (TotalCharges and MonthlyCharges)
Offer discounts or personalized plans for customers with high TotalCharges and MonthlyCharges to improve satisfaction.
Highlight benefits or provide additional value (e.g., faster speeds, premium content) to justify the cost for high-paying customers.
2. Improve Retention for New Customers (Tenure)
Create onboarding programs to engage customers within the first 12 months of their subscription.
Offer special incentives, such as discounts or loyalty rewards, for customers who cross key milestones like 6 months or 1 year.
3. Promote Long-Term Contracts
Encourage month-to-month customers to switch to 1-year or 2-year contracts by offering discounts or bonuses (e.g., free premium services for the first 3 months).
Communicate the long-term cost savings of fixed contracts in marketing campaigns.
