# Telco-Customer-Churn-Analysis
Objective: Analyze key drivers of churn for a telecommunications company using advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques to predict whether a customer will churn.

Steps to follow:
Load the dataset and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
Clean the data (handle missing values, remove outliers, encode categorical variables).
Perform feature selection using correlation matrices or feature importance scores.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost.
Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Insights/Results:
Identify key drivers of churn, such as customer tenure or contract type.
Achieve a model with at least 80% accuracy and actionable insights for retention strategies.
